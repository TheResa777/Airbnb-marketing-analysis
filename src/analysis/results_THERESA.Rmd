### Summary of the Data set

<!-- Hi there, welcome to our Regression Analysis data set,`ListingsCovid`, which consist of 13 variables and captures 252 observations in total! To get a brief overview of our data set, the following is a statistics summary of key variables used to carry out the regression analysis. The variables are segmented according to countries. -->

```{r statistics_summary, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
table1::label(ListingsCovid$room_type)<-"Room Types"
table1::label(ListingsCovid$log_price) <-"Average Price(log)"
table1::label(ListingsCovid$availability_365) <-"Availability"
table1::label(ListingsCovid$number_of_reviews_ltm)<-"New Reviews per Quarter"
table1::label(ListingsCovid$reviews_per_month)<-"Monthly Reviews"
table1::label(ListingsCovid$weekly_count) <- "Weekly Covid Cases"

overview_1 <- table1::table1(~ room_type + log_price + availability_365 + number_of_reviews_ltm + reviews_per_month+weekly_count|country_code, data = ListingsCovid)
```

```{r loading statistics summary table, echo =FALSE}
t1kable(overview_1) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), font_size = 11)
```

### Histogram of Average Price(log)

The histogram below,shows the distribution of average price (log). The majority of data points are clustered on the right side of the histogram.Also there are quite a few outliers is data set.

```{r distribution of price by country, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(ListingsCovid, aes(log_price)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.3, color="black", fill= "#FF5A60")+ labs(x = "Average Price (log)", y = "Frequency")

```

### Scatter-plot of Average Price (log) per weekly Covid-19 cases

<!-- The scatter plot shows..... -->

<!-- According to the statistics summary, entire home/apartment accumulates more than half of the observations. This tendency also appears across listings of each city. Taking up the second most offered type of room is private room. What we could take on from here is that the Airbnb landscape in European market values privacy and personal comfort but at the same time the guests can stay close to local neighbourhood compared to traditional hotels. -->

# `{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE} # ggplot(ListingsCovid, #        aes(x = weekly_count, y = avg_price, color = country_code)) + #   geom_point() + labs(y = "Average price(log)", x = "Weekly Covid count(log)", color = "Country")+ scale_y_log10(breaks = trans_breaks("log10", function(x) 10^x),labels = trans_format("log10", math_format(10^.x)))+ scale_x_log10(breaks = trans_breaks("log10", function(x) 10^x), #               labels = trans_format("log10", math_format(10^.x)))`

### Scatter-plot of Average Price (log) and weekly Covid-19 cases by country

According to the statistics summary, entire home/apartment accumulates more than half of the observations. This tendency also appears across listings of each city. Taking up the second most offered type of room is private room. What we could take on from here is that the Airbnb landscape in European market values privacy and personal comfort but at the same time the guests can stay close to local neighbourhood compared to traditional hotels.

```{r Price per weekly count by country code, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(ListingsCovid,
       aes(x = weekly_count, y = avg_price, color = country_code, digits=0))+ scale_y_log10(breaks = trans_breaks("log10", function(x) 10^x),labels = trans_format("log10", math_format(10^.x)))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Price per weekly Covid count by country") +
  facet_wrap(~ country_code) + labs(y = "Average price(log)", x = "Weekly Covid count", color = "Country")
```

<!-- ### Model 1: Simple regression with the dependent variable as Average Price (log) and independent variable as weekly Covid-19 cases. -->

<!-- According to the statistics summary, entire home/apartment accumulates more than half of the observations. This tendency also appears across listings of each city. Taking up the second most offered type of room is private room. What we could take on from here is that the Airbnb landscape in European market values privacy and personal comfort but at the same time the guests can stay close to local neighbourhood compared to traditional hotels. -->

```{r simple regression, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

regression1 <- lm(log_price ~ weekly_count,ListingsCovid)

pander(summary(regression1))

```

### Model 2: Multiple Regression with other characteristics of listings.

According to the statistics summary, entire home/apartment accumulates more than half of the observations. This tendency also appears across listings of each city. Taking up the second most offered type of room is private room. What we could take on from here is that the Airbnb landscape in European market values privacy and personal comfort but at the same time the guests can stay close to local neighbourhood compared to traditional hotels. <!--#  -->

```{r Regression Analysis Model 1, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
  regression2 <- lm(log_price ~ weekly_count +
      room_type + minimum_nights +
      reviews_per_month +
      number_of_reviews_ltm +
      availability_365,
    ListingsCovid)
    
pander(summary(regression2))
```

### Model 2: Checking for Multicollinearity.

All analysed variables have a GVIF below 10. According to the rule of thumb, there is no problem with multicollinearity for any of the variables.

```{r checking multicollinearity of Model 1, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ListingsCovid_lm1 <- lm(log_price ~ weekly_count +
                        room_type + minimum_nights +
                        reviews_per_month +
                        number_of_reviews_ltm +
                        availability_365, ListingsCovid)
vif(ListingsCovid_lm1) %>% kable(caption = "*Model 2: checking multicollinearity*")

```

### Model 2: Check for Heteroskedasticity.

The residuals in model 2 have an unequal variance across all the independent variables, which indicates heteroskedasticy.

```{r checking heteroskedasticity of Model 1, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
my_color <- "#FF5A60"

residuals_lm2 <- ListingsCovid_lm1$residuals
ggplot(ListingsCovid, aes(x = weekly_count, y = residuals_lm2)) + geom_point( color = my_color)+ geom_smooth( color = "black", method = "glm", formula = y~x,size = 0.5) + labs(y = "Average price(log)", x = "Weekly Covid count", title= "Heteroskedasticity of model 2") + theme(plot.title = element_text(color="black", size=14, hjust = 0.5,face= "italic"))
```

### Model 3: Regression with added interactions between weekly Covid-19 cases and room types.

We have added the interaction between weekly_count and room_type to model 2 to check if it would improve the model fit. By comparing the R squared from model 2 and model 3, it is evident that the the R squared has barely increased.

```{r Regression Analysis Model 2, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
regression3 <- lm(log_price ~ weekly_count * room_type +
    minimum_nights +
    reviews_per_month +
    number_of_reviews_ltm +
    availability_365,
  ListingsCovid) 

pander(summary(regression3))
```

### Model 3: Checking for Multicollinearity

The variable minimum_nights has the lowest GVIF, so it has the weakest correlation. Whereas,the highest is for the interaction between weekly_count and room_type. Interaction terms naturally produce higher multicollinearity. All analysed variables have a GVIF below 10. According to the rule of thumb,there is no problem with multicollinearity for any of the variables.

```{r checking multicollinearity of Model 3, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ListingsCovid_lm3 <-lm(log_price ~ weekly_count * room_type +
                         minimum_nights +
                         reviews_per_month +
                         number_of_reviews_ltm +
                         availability_365,
                       ListingsCovid)
vif(ListingsCovid_lm3)%>% kable(caption = "*Model 3: checking multicollinearity*")
```

### Model 3: Checking for Heteroskedasticity.

The residuals in model 3 have an unequal variance across all the independent variables, which indicates heteroskedasticy.

```{r checking heteroskedasticity of Model 3, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
residuals_lm3 <- ListingsCovid_lm3$residuals
ggplot(ListingsCovid, aes(x = weekly_count, y = residuals_lm3)) + geom_point(color = my_color) + geom_smooth( color = "black", method = "glm", formula = y~x,size = 0.5) +
  labs(y = "Residuals", x = "Weekly Covid count", title= "Model 3: checking heteroskedasticity") + theme(plot.title = element_text(color="black", size=14, hjust = 0.5,face="italic"))



```

### Conclusion

In conclusion model 3 has the best model fit.
